# 01. DevOps

## DevOps definition
- http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/devops/
> DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach. DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), andseeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology, especially automation tools, that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective

> DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users.
I am very deliberate in the terms used in this definition. I choose value over software.  DevOps is not just automating a pipeline so we can quickly deliver software. Our goal is to deliver value.  The term end users was also very carefully chosen.  The value we produce must reach our end users.  If the value only reaches the Dev and QA environments but is held up before reaching production where it can be realized by our end users, we are still failing.
It is very important to realize that DevOps is not a product.  You cannot buy DevOps and install it.  DevOps is not just automation or infrastructure as code.  DevOps is people following a process enabled by products to deliver value to our end users.

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market
